This means that if you eat dinner at 8 p.m., you won't have breakfast until 8 a.m. the following morning. 12:12 is considered to be the easiest type of IF, and as a rookie,  find out the changes that happened to my body over the span of 21 days</p>.</div></div>

            <div class="content"><h3>skipping</h3><p>Skipping ropes are very cheap and widely available in sports retailers, or you can even make your own. To make sure that your rope is the correct length for your height, stand on the middle of the rope and pull the handles upwards until the rope is taut. The handles should be in line with the middle of your chest. If the handles come up higher, cut a few inches of rope off one end until you have the correct length.  </p></div>
